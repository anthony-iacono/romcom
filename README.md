This application creates random and custom romance novel covers.  

Users can generate random covers from existing stored data (Show New Random Cover) or create a custom book from user-added data (Make Your Own Cover).  User input data are stored and available for use when generating random covers.

Users can also save covers to display in a 'View Saved Covers" view.  In the "View Saved Covers" view, users can enlarge the cover by clicking on it.  To unsave the cover, double click on the cover.
